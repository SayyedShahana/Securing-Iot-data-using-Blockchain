# Securing-Iot-data-using-Blockchain
This project focuses on enhancing the security of IoT sensor data by integrating blockchain technology. It ensures data integrity, transparency, and tamper-resistance by storing hashed IoT data on a decentralized ledger.
**Tech Stack**
IoT Devices: Arduino (with sensors for data collection)
Cloud Platform: Firebase (for real-time IoT data storage)
Blockchain: Ethereum (via Truffle framework, Solidity for smart contracts)
IPFS: For decentralized file storage
Frontend: React.js
Tools: MetaMask, Ganache (for local blockchain testing)

⚙️ Key Features
Real-time data fetched from Arduino sensors to Firebase
IoT data is hashed and stored on IPFS
Blockchain records the IPFS hash to ensure immutability
Smart contract written in Solidity to manage data logs
MetaMask integration for secure blockchain interaction
